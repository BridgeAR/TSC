# The Node.js Foundation TSC

The Node.js Foundation Technical Steering Committee is the technical governing body of the Node.js Foundation. It admits and oversees all top-level Projects in the Node.js Foundation. It also elects a representative to the Node.js Foundation Board of Directors.

The TSC is community and contributor driven and is a home for community managed 
projects and assets. The mission of the Node.js Foundation is to enable and encourage 
the adoption of Node.js and the TSC is the home of the community driven portion
of executing that mission.

Since the Foundation and the TSC are intended to support the community the size and scope
of the work and projects in it will grow to accomodate the needs of the community.

For more details read the [TSC Charter](https://github.com/nodejs/TSC/blob/master/TSC-Charter.md) adopted by the Node.js Foundation Board of Directors on June 17th 2015.

If your project is interested in joining the Node.js Foundation please read the [Project Lifecycle.md](./Project-Lifecycle.md) documentation.

## Projects, Working Groups and the Incubator

The Node.js Foundation is setup to be the home of multiple autonomous projects. Projects are 
admitted into the incubator and are mentored until their governance and contributor 
base reach a state of maturity. They are then given a proper charter and a seat on the TSC.

The TSC also forms Working Groups to tackle tasks that don't scope to a single project. These 
Working Groups can be given a seat on the TSC at the TSC's discretion.

The goal of the Incubator is to:

* Support the Node.js Ecosystem.
* Provide a neutral "home" for projects so that they are not owned by a single individual or company.
* Mentor projects in the Node.js community on open governance and liberal contribution policies.
* Ensure that the Node.js Foundation does not charter projects that do not adhere to the values 
of the Node.js Foundation. Projects must be: Transparent, Participatory and Effective.
* The TSC does not "pick winners" and may admit multiple projects that serve similar use cases. 
Admitting a project for incubation or even chartering it is not an endorsement by the Node.js 
Foundation or TSC on the technical merits of a project, it is only an endorsement that the project 
adheres to the TSC's values.

Other than being written in Node.js there are no technical requirements on projects to be admitted
into the Node.js Foundation. However, because resources may be limited from time to the TSC may
elect to delay admission until resources become available.

## TSC Members

TSC members are responsible for top level technical community concerns. The role is 
mostly administrative and is responsible for admitting new Top Level Projects, Top Level
Working Groups, and advocating for any needs in the technical side of the foundation to
the Node.js Foundation Board of Directors.

TSC members can nominate new members at any time. Candidates for membership tend to be people
who have a competancy for community management and a high tolerance and patience for process
minutiae as the TSC delegates most of its responsibilities to other projects and working groups.

Every Top Level Project not currently incubating can appoint someone to the TSC who they elect
at their own discretion.

## Top-Level WGs and TLPs

* [Working Groups](WORKING_GROUPS.md)
* Mentors

    Project mentorship is not a technical role. In fact, mentors are
    discouraged from giving technical advice to projects. Instead, the
    purpose of mentorship is to encourage and improve a projects ability
    to be participatory, transparent, and effective. Mentors are there to
    help projects adopt and iterate on policies and processes that achieve
    these goals and eventually allow them to graduate the incubation phase.

## Policy Change Proposal Process

The Node.js TSC is chartered to oversee the technical governance of all Top
Level Projects and Working Groups under the Node.js Foundation. The TSC
establishes the default governance, conduct, and licensing policies for all Top
Level Projects. Top Level Projects and Working Groups have broad powers of
self-governance.

To propose a change or addition to policies or processes that are intended to
cover all Top Level Projects and Working Groups in the foundation, a PR should
be opened in the `nodejs/TSC` repository.

The pull request can be labeled `tsc-agenda` to request that it be put on the
agenda for the next TSC meeting.

The Node.js Foundation Board of Directors retains certain rights (especially
legal considerations). If the TSC endorses a proposal, they will escalate to the
Node.js Foundation Board of Directors when required to do so.

In some cases, existing individual groups have the right to refuse changes to
their charters. The TSC can not mandate existing working groups alter their
charters. If such a situation arises, the TSC may decide to revoke the group's
charter.
