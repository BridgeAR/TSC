# The Node.js Foundation TSC

The Node.js Foundation Technical Steering Committee is the technical governing body of the Node.js Foundation. It admits and oversees all top-level Projects in the Node.js Foundation. It also elects a representative to the Node.js Foundation Board of Directors.

It is the mission of the Node.js Foundation and the TSC to provide a home for 
openly-governed and community-managed open source projects that are focused on 
supporting and providing benefit to the entire Node.js ecosystem.

Project and Working Groups under the TSC are governed by the contributors
and users of those projects.

Since the Foundation and the TSC are intended to support the community the size and scope
of the work and projects in it will grow to accomodate the needs of the community.

For more details read the [TSC Charter](https://github.com/nodejs/TSC/blob/master/TSC-Charter.md) adopted by the Node.js Foundation Board of Directors on June 17th 2015.

If your project is interested in joining the Node.js Foundation please read the [Project Lifecycle.md](./Project-Lifecycle.md) documentation.

## Projects, Working Groups and the Incubator

The Node.js Foundation is structured to serve as a home for multiple 
autonomous projects. Projects are first admitted into an incubation 
phase where they are mentored until the project governance and 
contributor base reaches a state of maturity. The TSC then works 
with the project to establish an official charter and a seat on the TSC.

The TSC also forms Working Groups to tackle tasks that don't scope to a single project. These 
Working Groups can be given a seat on the TSC at the TSC's discretion.

The goal of the Incubator is to:

* Support the ecosystem of Node.js users and contributors by providing a 
  home for openly governed and community managed projects built on, or 
  built to support Node.js.
* Mentor projects within the Node.js community on open governance and liberal 
  contribution policies.
* Ensure that the Node.js Foundation does not charter projects that do not 
  adhere to the values upon which the Node.js Foundation was established. 
  Projects must be: Transparent, Participatory and Effective.
* Ensure that the Node.js Foundation and the TSC does not "pick a winner" in 
  the ecosystem by equally and fairly mentoring multiple projects that serve 
  similar use cases. Admitting project's for incubation, or chartering mature 
  projects, is not an endorsement by the Node.js Foundation or TSC on the 
  technical merits of a project; rather, it is an endorsement that the project 
  adheres to the Node.js Foundation and TSC's open governance values.

There are no technical requirements on projects to be admitted into the Node.js 
Foundation incubator. The projects will, however, be evaluated on various 
criteria including alignment with Node.js Foundation goals, support of and for 
the Node.js ecosystem, and relevance of scope to Node.js development. 

Because resources may be limited from time to time the TSC may elect to delay 
admission until resources become available.

## TSC Members

TSC members are responsible for top level technical community concerns. The role is 
mostly administrative and is responsible for admitting new Top Level Projects, Top Level
Working Groups, and advocating for any needs in the technical side of the foundation to
the Node.js Foundation Board of Directors.

TSC members can nominate new members at any time. Candidates for membership tend to be people
who have a competancy for community management and a high tolerance and patience for process
minutiae as the TSC delegates most of its responsibilities to other projects and working groups.

Every Top Level Project not currently incubating can appoint someone to the TSC who they elect
at their own discretion.

## Top-Level WGs and TLPs

* [Working Groups](WORKING_GROUPS.md)
* Mentors

    Project mentorship is not a technical role. In fact, mentors are
    discouraged from giving technical advice to projects. Instead, the
    purpose of mentorship is to encourage and improve a projects ability
    to be participatory, transparent, and effective. Mentors are there to
    help projects adopt and iterate on policies and processes that achieve
    these goals and eventually allow them to graduate the incubation phase.

## Policy Change Proposal Process

The Node.js TSC is chartered to oversee the technical governance of all Top
Level Projects and Working Groups under the Node.js Foundation. The TSC
establishes the default governance, conduct, and licensing policies for all Top
Level Projects. Top Level Projects and Working Groups have broad powers of
self-governance.

To propose a change or addition to policies or processes that are intended to
cover all Top Level Projects and Working Groups in the foundation, a PR should
be opened in the `nodejs/TSC` repository.

The pull request can be labeled `tsc-agenda` to request that it be put on the
agenda for the next TSC meeting.

The Node.js Foundation Board of Directors retains certain rights (especially
legal considerations). If the TSC endorses a proposal, they will escalate to the
Node.js Foundation Board of Directors when required to do so.

In some cases, existing individual groups have the right to refuse changes to
their charters. The TSC can not mandate existing working groups alter their
charters. If such a situation arises, the TSC may decide to revoke the group's
charter.
