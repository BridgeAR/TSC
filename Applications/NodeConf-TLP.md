## Introduction

## History & Metrics

NodeConf was started in 2011 by Mikeal Rogers (@mikeal) and Chris Williams (@voodootikigod).

Today there are several NodeConf's all run by differnet organizers who loosely support each other in the `nodeconf` GitHub org.

## Scope

All current and future NodeConf's:

* NodeConf US (currently in hiatus)
* NodeConf Adventure
* NodeConf EU
* NodeConf London
* NodeConf Barcelona
* NodeConf Christchurch
* NodeConf Santa Cruz
* NodeConf Buenos Aires
* NodeConf Austin
* NodeConf Oakland
* NodeConf Oslo

## Governance

Individual NodeConf's are considered Working Groups under the Foundation's Governance model.

The NodeConf Community is independently governed by existing conference organizers. The TC (Technical Committee) will use the 
consensus seeking process that has become the standard in Node.js Core for some time.

A single seat on the TC is appointed by each Conference WG.

## Contribution Process

Anyone interested in running a NodeConf can create an issue on the `organizers` repo (currently called the `collective` repo).
If no objections are raised by the TC a new team and repo will be created that is owned by the requesting organizers.
